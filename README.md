# DeterminantalPointProcess
Department of Mathematics Cornell University Senior Thesis

The focus of this senior thesis will be Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), encompassing an exploration of background information, applications, and simulations to validate findings within the field. In the introductory section, I aim to provide definitions of various types of DPPs, highlight their properties, and present relevant theorems. Additionally, I will provide background about widely recognized DPP applications, including Aztec Diamond tiling's, Gaussian Unitary Ensembles, Non-intersecting random walks, and the random words problem. A specific emphasis will be placed on the random word uniform measure and corresponding Charlier ensemble DPP, supported by a simulation to verify the equivalence of the two outcomes. There has no formal verification of computer simulations of checking to see if the sampling from the kernel of these two processes results in similar results as empirical implementations. Moreover, I intend to investigate the approximation of Determinantal Point Processes through deep networks. Lastly, I will explore the applications of DPPs, particularly within the realm of machine learning, a domain that has recently attracted increased attention.
